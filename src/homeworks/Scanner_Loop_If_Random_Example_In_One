* We are going to make a GAME!
* The concept is: Generate a random number and ask the user to quess the number,
* continue asking until you receive the number
* after 5 times of quessing show a game over message
*
* Here is how it works:
* Show a welcome message
* Ask the User's name and sav hello to thd user
* Ask if we should start the game
* After receiving a positive answer generate a random number and ask for the user's quess
* If the quess is correct show a congratulation message and quit the game
* If the number is not correct, ask again until you receive the correct answer
* As a hint, beside the first time, every time that you are asking for a number, tell the user to guess higher or lower
* If the User failed 5 times, show a game over message and quit the game
